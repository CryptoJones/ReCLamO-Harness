# Task: author ONE independent long-context evaluation task (as a runnable Python generator)

You are helping evaluate a "Recursive Language Model" (RLM) harness. The system under test receives
two strings — a very long CONTEXT and a QUESTION — and returns an ANSWER string. Internally it may run
code over the context and call a language model on pieces of it, but you should treat it as a black box.
The model behind it has a ~32K-token working window; contexts will be far larger than that.

The harness authors wrote their own tests, and we suspect those tests are too easy and shaped to the
harness. We want tests written by someone else: you. Do NOT try to guess how the harness works and do
not design around it. Design a task that a careful human analyst with plenty of time would get right,
but that is genuinely hard to get right without actually reading and reasoning over much of the context.

## Requirements (all mandatory)
1. Deliver a SINGLE self-contained Python 3.11 file in one ```python code block. Standard library only.
2. It must expose: `generate(seed: int, size: str) -> dict` returning
   `{"context": str, "question": str, "answer": <ground truth>, "meta": {...}}`
   with `size` in {"small", "medium", "large"} giving roughly 60K, 300K and 1.2M characters of context.
   And `score(answer_text: str, truth) -> float` in [0, 1], robust to formatting (case, punctuation,
   ordering, extra prose) but NOT lenient about the substance.
3. Fully deterministic given the seed (use `random.Random(seed)`, no time, no network, no files).
4. Ground truth must be computed by the generator from its own data structures — never hand-written.
5. **Grep-resistant**: the answer must not be recoverable by keyword search, regex, or simple counting
   of surface tokens. Use paraphrase, varied vocabulary, distractors, negations, coreference
   ("the latter", "her manager"), corrections later in the text that override earlier statements,
   and facts whose meaning depends on other parts of the document. State in a comment WHY a regex /
   keyword approach fails on your task.
6. **Requires breadth**: the correct answer must depend on information spread across the whole
   context (aggregation, multi-hop joins, temporal reasoning, consistency checking, etc.), not one spot.
7. Natural-looking prose or semi-structured text (emails, logs, minutes, reports, chat) — not
   obviously synthetic key=value lines.
8. Include a short `if __name__ == "__main__":` that prints size stats, the question and the truth for
   seed 0 at each size, and asserts `score(str(truth), truth) == 1.0` and that a few wrong answers score < 1.

## Deliverable format
- One paragraph: the task, what skill it tests, why it is hard, and the main way a solver would fail.
- The single ```python block.
- Nothing else. Do not read or modify any files; you do not need tools for this.

# Revision request

You previously answered this brief with the generator below. An independent validator (runs it in a clean python:3.12-slim container, separate processes, no network) found this defect:

**score(str(truth), truth) returns 0.5, not 1.0 — your scorer cannot parse its own truth, which is a tuple like ('Priya Patel', 39195), and your own self-test fails on that assert. Fix score() so the stringified truth and natural phrasings ('Priya Patel, $39,195') score 1.0 while wrong names/amounts score < 1.**

Return a corrected version that satisfies the whole brief. Same deliverable format: one paragraph (mention what you changed) then the single complete ```python block. Keep the same task idea.
