**Task:** Temporal coreference resolution in a simulated corporate email thread. The generator creates a timeline of ownership changes (assignments, reassignments, declines, corrections) for an AI Ethics Review, interleaved with filler emails about unrelated topics. The final owner must be determined by processing the entire sequence in order, as later corrections and reassignments override earlier statements. A keyword or regex approach fails because ownership is expressed through varied phrasing (e.g., "taking over", "declined", "correction: under X department"), coreferences ("the lead", "they"), and negations ("no longer involved"), and the ground truth depends on integrating information distributed across the whole timeline, not local patterns. Determinism is now ensured by replacing all non-deterministic set iterations (e.g., `rng.choice(list(set))`) with indexed choices over sorted lists, and removing any reliance on hash-sensitive iteration order.
