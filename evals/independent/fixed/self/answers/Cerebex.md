The defect: when the generated truth happened to be `0` (no qualifying travel reports), the self-test's deliberately wrong answer `0` scored a perfect 1.0, and more generally `score()` returned 1.0 if *any* number anywhere in the answer matched, making it lenient about substance (an answer rattling off many figures could luck into a match). I fixed `score()` to be strict: it extracts all numeric tokens, requires the **final** substantive number to equal the ground truth for full credit (with comma/currency/decimal tolerance), and awards at most 0.5 partial credit if the correct figure merely appears among other conflicting numbers — so any answer whose concluding figure is wrong scores < 1 regardless of prose. I also changed the self-test's wrong answers to values guaranteed distinct from the truth (no more `0` collision) and kept the task, generator, and grep-resistance design unchanged.

"""
Long-context evaluation task: "Amended Travel Reimbursement Audit".

The context is a chronological corporate email archive. Buried in it are expense
reports described in prose; many are later amended by follow-up emails (amount
corrections, approvals rescinded, denials reversed, approvers delegated).

QUESTION: total USD of *travel* reports whose FINAL status (after every
correction) is "approved", and whose effective approver is a manager in the
Operations division (accounting for delegation emails).

WHY GREP/REGEX FAILS:
 - The tokens "travel", "approved", "$<number>" occur pervasively in distractor
   emails (other categories, other divisions, negations like "we will not be
   approving", chatter about travel bookings that are not expense reports).
 - Amendments never cite report IDs in most cases; they refer to reports by
   paraphrase ("the Oslo invoice Maria sent in March", "scratch that figure I
   gave you"). The final amount of a report is often stated ONLY as a
   correction of an earlier amount ("the real total came to $X, not $Y").
 - Approval emails sometimes reverse an earlier denial, and rescission emails
   reverse an earlier approval, so surface status words are unreliable.
 - Two employees can share a first name across divisions; coreference
   ("her manager", "the latter") must be resolved.
The answer therefore requires reading/reasoning over the whole document.
