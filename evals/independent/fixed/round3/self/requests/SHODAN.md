# Task: author ONE independent long-context evaluation task (as a runnable Python generator)

You are helping evaluate a "Recursive Language Model" (RLM) harness. The system under test receives
two strings — a very long CONTEXT and a QUESTION — and returns an ANSWER string. Internally it may run
code over the context and call a language model on pieces of it, but you should treat it as a black box.
The model behind it has a ~32K-token working window; contexts will be far larger than that.

The harness authors wrote their own tests, and we suspect those tests are too easy and shaped to the
harness. We want tests written by someone else: you. Do NOT try to guess how the harness works and do
not design around it. Design a task that a careful human analyst with plenty of time would get right,
but that is genuinely hard to get right without actually reading and reasoning over much of the context.

## Requirements (all mandatory)
1. Deliver a SINGLE self-contained Python 3.11 file in one ```python code block. Standard library only.
2. It must expose: `generate(seed: int, size: str) -> dict` returning
   `{"context": str, "question": str, "answer": <ground truth>, "meta": {...}}`
   with `size` in {"small", "medium", "large"} giving roughly 60K, 300K and 1.2M characters of context.
   And `score(answer_text: str, truth) -> float` in [0, 1], robust to formatting (case, punctuation,
   ordering, extra prose) but NOT lenient about the substance.
3. Fully deterministic given the seed (use `random.Random(seed)`, no time, no network, no files).
4. Ground truth must be computed by the generator from its own data structures — never hand-written.
5. **Grep-resistant**: the answer must not be recoverable by keyword search, regex, or simple counting
   of surface tokens. Use paraphrase, varied vocabulary, distractors, negations, coreference
   ("the latter", "her manager"), corrections later in the text that override earlier statements,
   and facts whose meaning depends on other parts of the document. State in a comment WHY a regex /
   keyword approach fails on your task.
6. **Requires breadth**: the correct answer must depend on information spread across the whole
   context (aggregation, multi-hop joins, temporal reasoning, consistency checking, etc.), not one spot.
7. Natural-looking prose or semi-structured text (emails, logs, minutes, reports, chat) — not
   obviously synthetic key=value lines.
8. Include a short `if __name__ == "__main__":` that prints size stats, the question and the truth for
   seed 0 at each size, and asserts `score(str(truth), truth) == 1.0` and that a few wrong answers score < 1.

## Deliverable format
- One paragraph: the task, what skill it tests, why it is hard, and the main way a solver would fail.
- The single ```python block.
- Nothing else. Do not read or modify any files; you do not need tools for this.

# Revision request (round 3: independent audit)

An independent auditor solved your task from the text alone, then traced your generator, and ran 1,701 scorer probes. Findings for your current generator (below):

**Scorer: (~612-615, ~654) gives 0 to 'Alderwick office: 0' and to JSON keys like 'Alderwick Office'. (Answer key verified sound; do not change generation.)**

**SCORER FAIRNESS (applies to every task): score() must give 1.0 to a correct answer in any reasonable format — bare value, a sentence ('The answer is X.'), markdown bold/italics, quotes, bullet list, JSON, trailing period, case changes, numbers with/without $ and thousands commas, extra explanation before/after — and must give < 1.0 (ideally 0) to wrong answers AND to hedged answers that name more than one candidate (e.g. 'A or B', 'not X; it is Y' where X is wrong but listed, two names, two amounts). Add self-test asserts for these formats and hedges across seeds 0-4.**

Return a corrected version that satisfies the whole brief (sizes ~60K/300K/1.2M, deterministic across processes, stdlib only, valid Python 3.11 syntax: no backslashes inside f-string expressions). Keep the task idea and difficulty. Same deliverable format: one paragraph (what you changed) then the single complete ```python block.

## Current generator

```python
"""Independent long-context freight reconciliation benchmark. Python 3.11.

Why keyword search, regex extraction, or surface counting is insufficient:
every shipment has both provisional and authoritative descriptions. Positive
and negative words occur in both, including references to irrelevant samples.
A solver must resolve nicknames, former/latter references, personnel joins,
contract-specific Boolean conditions, and explicit corrections before doing
weighted aggregation. No passage contains the requested office totals.

A purpose-built semantic parser could solve this task; that is legitimate.
The benchmark does not claim that programmatic reasoning is impossible.

INTRO = """Freight cooperative — May closing correspondence

The closing date is 31 May. This packet contains provisional records followed
by signed corrections. All money-like amounts below are integer credit units.

Closing instructions:
* Each docket is one shipment. Its quoted nickname identifies the same shipment
  wherever that nickname appears. Names and nicknames are exact identifiers.
* Use the signed replacement laboratory finding for both tests and the seal.
  It replaces the entire preliminary laboratory report for that shipment.
  "Passed", "met the limit", and equivalent language mean success; a failure
  means the test did not satisfy its requirement.
* Each agreement specifies whether BOTH tests, AT LEAST ONE test, or EXACTLY
  ONE test must succeed. Apply its closing amendment, including its final rate,
  allowance, and treatment of packaging waivers.
* Packaging is acceptable if the shipment's own seal was intact, OR if a waiver
  was actually signed AND the agreement permits waivers. Permission to use a
  waiver does not itself establish that a waiver was signed.
* The signed final carrier audit alone determines custody at closing. Credit
  requires that the consignee retained the shipment at closing. Earlier
  deliveries, returns, plans, and reports about other crates do not decide it.
* Use final reconciled shipped units and damaged units. For an eligible shipment,
  credited units are max(shipped minus damaged minus the agreement allowance, 0).
  Its credit is credited units multiplied by the final agreement rate.
  Ineligible shipments contribute zero. There are no other fees or credits.
* The final accounts reconciliation names the responsible contact by radio name.
  Join that radio name through the personnel directory to a person, then through
  the closing personnel correction to that person's manager, then through the
  manager's closing office correction to an office. This closing chain controls
  attribution even if a shipment was handled elsewhere earlier in the month.
* Every signed closing correction in this packet applies to the whole May
  closing. These are the only revisions; there are no ties in authority.
  Reserve contacts, relief managers, training crates, and unsigned proposals
  are not authoritative.

The requested result is the sum of shipment credits for each closing office.
