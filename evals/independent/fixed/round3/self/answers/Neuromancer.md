I have revised the generator and scorer to address the auditor's findings. The generator now uses context‑appropriate language for adjustments (increase vs. decrease) and the scorer explicitly rejects hedged answers that mention more than one candidate amount or include negated amounts. The self‑tests now cover multiple seeds and a range of answer formats and hedge patterns.

```python
import random
import re
from typing import Dict, Any, List, Tuple

def generate(seed: int, size: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    rng = random.Random(seed)

    # Size parameters: (total entries, target chars)

        "large":  (500, 1200000)
    }
    num_entries, target_chars = size_params[size]

    # Force at least one March travel entry with non-zero final amount (not denied)
